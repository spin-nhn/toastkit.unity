### Adapter

IdPs, such as Facebook or Google, provide Unity SDK to apply IdP functions faster and more easily in applications under development for Unity.<br/> However, as each IdP has different API, sufficient learning and time is required to implement each and every IdP function. <br/>
TOAST Kit Adapter provides a common interface so as to easily apply different IdP fuctions.
